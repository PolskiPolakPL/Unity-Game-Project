A Unity RTS Game Project made for collage, continued for passion.


  Â 
## Description
The **Battle of Elbing** is a simple RTS game where you fight for control over the old town of Elbing. Originally conceived as a collaborative effort for Unity classes, this project has evolved into individual passion project. Despite being essentially a one-man project, certain assets have been crafted with the invaluable support of my close friends.
## Contributors
- [**PolskiPolakPL**](https://github.com/PolskiPolakPL) - Main Programer & Game Designer
- [**Skoppek**](https://github.com/Skoppek) - Support Developer (in early stages of the project)
- [**Konti24**](https://github.com/konti24) - 3D Graphic Designer (in early stages of the project)

## Current Status
The game is now complete and publicly available on **Itch.io**. Earlier iterations can still be found in a separate repository, linked at the bottom of this file. This version represents the final product that was created over time through occasional updates and refactoring.

## Future Plans
There are no plans for further development of this version beyond occasional minor fixes or adjustments. Due to its origins as a student assignment, the project carries the legacy of many quick decisions and short-term solutions made during its initial design phase. \
That said, a reimagined version 2.0 is planned for the future - built from the ground up with improved structure, new features, and a more cohesive vision. This future release will aim to deliver the experience that this original game only hinted at.
